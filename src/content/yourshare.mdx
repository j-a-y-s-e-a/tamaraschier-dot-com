    Share the costs, without creating IOU's

  <div className="text-description">
    People often share costs with others when they are out socialising, but no current way exists for people to split costs without first creating informal debt.

  ## User Research

  I conducted interviews with 5 people who fit the target audience of someone who pays with card and shares costs with others regularly. After interviews it became clear that insights could be grouped into 5 different categories

    <b>I found a gap in the market in the form of a product which would prevent the occurrence of informal debt.</b> An app which allows groups to evenly and simply split finances would be beneficial in preventing individualâ€™s losing track of their expenses and prevent the social awkwardness of following up finances

  ## Lessons Learned

  The lesson I learnt was to get too caught up on one idea and test early and often. This was especially true with my home screen as after testing

  In the future I would like to  to work on what the mechanism linking the card with Google or Apple pay may look like.
